The dependency graphs capture parent vs. child packages in Ada
* Ada package names may have dot in between, naturally split the name to parent child package name portion
* in dot graph: ltail vs. lhead means the source vs sink of edged is for a subgraph the node belongs to.  
   * It means the entire subgraph (parent package) is source of sink, instead of a child node (child package) within the subgraph 
   * still the individual node is used to indicate the edge. This can be confusing. 

In the example below, 
* it really means cluster_1 --> cluster_2
* but node_1 -> node_2 is used instead, annotated with [ltail=cluster_1, lhead=cluster_2]

digraph G {  
    compound=true;  
      
    subgraph cluster_1 {  
        label="parent_a";  
        node_1[label="child_a"];  
    }  
      
    subgraph cluster_2 {  
        label="parent_b";   
        node_2[label="child_b"];  
    }  
      
    node_1 -> node_2 [ltail=cluster_1, lhead=cluster_2];  
}
